{"name":"whitematteranalysis","tagline":"White matter tractography clustering, segmentation, registration","body":"#Synopsis\r\nwhitematteranalysis provides clustering and tractography analysis tools.\r\n\r\nIt implements algorithms from publications listed here:\r\nhttp://projects.iq.harvard.edu/whitematteranalysis/publications\r\n\r\n#Installation\r\n###1. Install python. \r\nAnaconda is a nice option since it has VTK and scipy.\r\nFirst install anaconda, then run: \r\n\r\n      conda install vtk\r\n\r\n###2. Install the following python packages (dependencies).\r\n\r\nOnce you have anaconda installed, run: \r\n\r\n      pip install joblib\r\n\r\nNote: If you decide to use another python that does not already have VTK, you can compile VTK.\r\n* VTK: http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Building\r\nYou will need to compile it with python wrapping.\r\n\r\n###3. Install whitematteranalysis into your python in the standard way.\r\n\r\n     cd whitematteranalysis\r\n     python setup.py install\r\n\r\n###4. Test the installation.\r\nRun python, then:\r\n\r\n    >>> import whitematteranalysis as wma\r\n\r\nThis will produce errors if the required packages are not found.\r\n\r\n###5. Scripts for performing data analyses are located in whitematteranalysis/bin. \r\n\r\n###6. Please see the wiki for usage instructions.\r\nhttps://github.com/ljod/whitematteranalysis/wiki\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
