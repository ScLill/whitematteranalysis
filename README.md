whitematteranalysis
===================

# Synopsis
White Matter Analysis provides clustering and tractography analysis tools.

It implements algorithms from publications listed here:
http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/whitematteranalysis/publications

Also see the github.io page here:
http://slicerdmri.github.io/whitematteranalysis/

# Installation
## 1. Install Python 2. 
Miniconda is a nice option since it includes up-to-date pip and setuptools and all library dependencies (such as VTK and scipy).

  - Download and install Miniconda (**Python 2**) from https://conda.io/miniconda.html

## 2. Install whitematteranalysis with pip:

The following command will use pip to install whitematteranalysis from this source repository and all library dependencies:

      pip install git+https://github.com/SlicerDMRI/whitematteranalysis.git

  (Note: On MacOS, to able to use pip, X-code needs to be installed using `xcode-select --install`.)

Run 'wm_quality_control_tractography.py --help' to test if the installation is successful. 

# Documentation
